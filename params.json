After initial beta test courses, we hope to keep the cost of participating as low as $5000 + airfare. Each course should include between 10-15 participants, including the guide, and teachers (subject matter experts who provide expert content and guidance on course topics) who may join us for only a week at a time. \r\n\r\nThe mission of Safari School courses will be radical self-development, in areas of knowledge, comprehension, confidence, authenticity, life skills, empathy, fitness, happiness, freedom and health. \r\n\r\nFor now, in the founders' development stage, our mission is to test measurable hypotheses of how these courses can be socially- and financially self-sustaining. We must discover the web copy and media that enrolls people in the courses, the mix of study and activities that optimizes self-development in this context, and how to reach the people who perfectly fit this project. \r\n\r\n#3 November 2015, Kirez @Secowi\r\n","google":"UA-69605133-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
