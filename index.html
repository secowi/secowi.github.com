<h3><span class="label label-primary"> What Safari School is </span></h3>
    Safari School will offer <abbr title="'4 weeks' is a variable or hypothesis to be tested">4-week-long</abbr> courses 
    of hard travel through 
    <abbr title="Examples: Cuba; Nepal-Burma-Bhutan-Vietnam; Iran; Argentina & Chile; Mongolia & Siberia; China; etc.">
    	an unusual or developing region</abbr>.
    <br><br>
During this travel, participants will engage in Socratic discussions of texts, writing and other
 assignments, local cultural immersion, and elective activities including volunteering, 
cooking, games, fitness training and more, aimed at fun and self-development.
<hr>
<h3><span class="label label-primary">Your Role in Safari School</span></h3>
After the initial beta test course, Safari School will enroll participants in professionally guided and taught courses,
with the cost of participating in a course as low as $4500 + airfare. 
Each course will include 10-15 participants, including <em>
<abbr title="The guide will be the 'flowmaster' of the groupâ€™s schedule and success, providing training wheels
 (in an increasingly self-directed, self-managed itinerary of travel, study and activities), 
 mentoring, support and security.">the Guide</abbr></em> and 1-2 
<abbr title="Teachers will provide expert guidance and coaching on course topics, 
and may join us for 5-10 days at a time."><em>Teachers</em></abbr>. 
<hr>
<h3><span class="label label-primary">The Why That Will Dictate Everything Else</span></h3>

The mission of Safari School courses is radical self-development in knowledge, 
comprehension, confidence, authenticity, life skills, empathy, fitness, happiness, teamwork, relationship skills and health.
<br><br>
Objective and subjective measurements of change from the course will be conducted by tests 
completed before and after the course (for example, fitness tests, health metrics, graded 
writing samples, and statements about important personal relationships).

  <p>Right now, November-December 2015, in the founders' development stage,
<div class="jumbotron">
  <h3>
Our mission is to test measurable hypotheses of how these courses can be 
socially- and financially self-sustaining. </h3>
<br>
<h3>For the non-entrepreneurs, non- <em>Lean Startup</em> speakers:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We are going to design a travel course</li>
	<li>DO the course (!)</li>
	<li>Offer the course to the public through http://SafariSchool.co</li>
	<li>Test and revise the offering until we enroll a full course, and thus make this dream a reality.</li>
</ul>
<h3>We will learn as much, as fast as possible, about what makes this successful,
to turn Safari School into an invincible cultural institution.
</h3>
</p>
</div>
  <div class="well">
  <h3>We must:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Enroll people who will participate and help build Safari School</li>
    <li>Discover the web copy and media that enrolls people in the courses</li>
    <li>Optimize the mix of travel, study, activities that yield passion for the course, and incredible, measurable personal transformation</li>
    <li>Do the first beta course together! This means you.</li>
