After the initial beta test course, Safari School will find and enroll participants through 
networking and public invitation. We will keep the cost of participating in a course as low as $4500 + airfare. 
Each course will include 10-15 participants, including <em>

The mission of Safari School courses will be radical self-development in knowledge, 
comprehension, confidence, authenticity, life skills, empathy, fitness, happiness and health. 
Objective and subjective measurements of change from the course will be conducted by tests 
completed before and after the course (for example, fitness tests, health metrics, graded 
writing samples, and statements about important personal relationships).
