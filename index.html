  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    Safari School will offer 4-week-long courses of hard travel through an unusual or developing region.
<p>During this travel, participants will engage in Socratic discussions of texts, writing and other 
self-expression assignments, local cultural immersion and elective activities including volunteering, 
cooking, games, fitness training and more, aimed at fun and self-development.</p>

    <h3 class="panel-title">Your Role in Safari School</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
After the initial beta test course(s?) (that’s you), Safari School will find and enroll participants through 
networking and public invitation. We will keep the cost of participating in a course as low as $4500 + airfare. 
Each course will include 10-15 participants, including (this may be you) the guide and 1-2 teachers. 
  </div>
</div>
Teachers will provide expert guidance and coaching on course topics, and may join us for 5-10 days at a time. Guides (that’s me, and perhaps you) will be the “flowmaster” of the group’s schedule and success, providing training wheels (in an increasingly self-directed, self-managed itinerary of travel, study and activities), mentoring, support and security.
The mission of Safari School courses will be radical self-development, in knowledge, comprehension, confidence, authenticity, life skills, empathy, fitness, happiness and health. Objective and subjective measurements of change from the course will be conducted by tests completed before and after the course (for example, fitness tests, health metrics, graded writing samples, and statements about important personal relationships).

Right now, in the founders' development stage, 
our mission is to test measurable hypotheses of how these courses can be socially- and financially self-sustaining.
