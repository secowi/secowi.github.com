<h3><span class="label label-primary">Your Role in Safari School</span></h3>
After the initial beta test course, Safari School will enroll participants in professionally guided and taught courses,
with the cost of participating in a course as low as $4500 + airfare. 
Each course will include 10-15 participants, including <em>
<abbr title="The guide will be the 'flowmaster' of the groupâ€™s schedule and success, providing training wheels
 (in an increasingly self-directed, self-managed itinerary of travel, study and activities), 
 mentoring, support and security.">the Guide</abbr></em> and 1-2 
<abbr title="Teachers will provide expert guidance and coaching on course topics, 
and may join us for 5-10 days at a time."><em>Teachers</em></abbr>. 
<br><br>
If you are reading this, we are inviting you to participate in a course as a beta tester, and as a prospective team member at Safari School.

<h3><span class="label label-primary">The Why That Dictates Everything Else</span></h3>
The mission of Safari School courses is extraordinary self-development in knowledge, 
comprehension, confidence, authenticity, life skills, empathy, fitness, happiness, teamwork, relationship skills and health.
<br><br>
Objective and subjective measurements of change from the course will be conducted by tests 
completed before and after the course (for example, fitness tests, health metrics, graded 
writing samples, and statements about important personal relationships).
